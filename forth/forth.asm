; Collapse OS' Forth
;
; Unlike other assembler parts of Collapse OS, this unit is one huge file.
;
; I do this because as Forth takes a bigger place, assembler is bound to take
; less and less place. I am thus consolidating that assembler code in one
; place so that I have a better visibility of what to minimize.
;
; I also want to reduce the featureset of the assembler so that Collapse OS
; self-hosts in a more compact manner. File include is a big part of the
; complexity in zasm. If we can get rid of it, we'll be more compact.

; *** ABI STABILITY ***
;
; This unit needs to have some of its entry points stay at a stable offset.
; These have a comment over them indicating the expected offset. These should
; not move until the Grand Bootstrapping operation has been completed.
;
; When you see random ".fill" here and there, it's to ensure that stability.

; *** Defines ***
; GETC: address of a GetC routine
; PUTC: address of a PutC routine
;
; Those GetC/PutC routines are hooked through defines and have this API:
;
; GetC: Blocks until a character is read from the device and return that
;       character in A.
;
; PutC: Write character specified in A onto the device.

; runtime.
.equ	PARSEPTR	@+2
; Pointer to the word executed by "C<". During stage0, this points to KEY.
; However, KEY ain't very interactive. This is why we implement a readline

; Sys Vars are variables with their value living in the system RAM segment. We
; need this mechanisms for core Forth source needing variables. Because core
; Forth source is pre-compiled, it needs to be able to live in ROM, which means
; that we can't compile a regular variable in it. SYSVNXT points to the next
; free space in SYSVBUF. Then, at the word level, it's a regular sysvarWord.
.equ	SYSVNXT		@+WORD_BUFSIZE
.equ	SYSVBUF		@+2
.equ	RAMEND		@+SYSV_BUFSIZE

; (HERE) usually starts at RAMEND, but in certain situations, such as in stage0,
; (HERE) will begin at a strategic place.
.equ	HERE_INITIAL	RAMEND

; EXECUTION MODEL
; After having read a line through readline, we want to interpret it. As
; a general rule, we go like this:
;
; 1. read single word from line
; 2. Can we find the word in dict?
; 3. If yes, execute that word, goto 1
; 4. Is it a number?
; 5. If yes, push that number to PS, goto 1
; 6. Error: undefined word.
;
; EXECUTING A WORD
;
; At it's core, executing a word is having the wordref in IY and call
; EXECUTE. Then, we let the word do its things. Some words are special,
; but most of them are of the compiledWord type, and that's their execution that
; we describe here.
;
; First of all, at all time during execution, the Interpreter Pointer (IP)
; points to the wordref we're executing next.
;
; When we execute a compiledWord, the first thing we do is push IP to the Return
; Stack (RS). Therefore, RS' top of stack will contain a wordref to execute
; next, after we EXIT.
;
; At the end of every compiledWord is an EXIT. This pops RS, sets IP to it, and
; continues.

; *** Stable ABI ***
; Those jumps below are supposed to stay at these offsets, always. If they
; change bootstrap binaries have to be adjusted because they rely on them.

; *** Collapse OS lib copy ***
; In the process of Forth-ifying Collapse OS, apps will be slowly rewritten to
; Forth and the concept of ASM libs will become obsolete. To facilitate this

; *** Stack management ***
; The Parameter stack (PS) is maintained by SP and the Return stack (RS) is
; maintained by IX. This allows us to generally use push and pop freely because
; PS is the most frequently used. However, this causes a problem with routine
; calls: because in Forth, the stack isn't balanced within each call, our return
; offset, when placed by a CALL, messes everything up. This is one of the
; reasons why we need stack management routines below. IX always points to RS'
; Top Of Stack (TOS)
;
; This return stack contain "Interpreter pointers", that is a pointer to the
; address of a word, as seen in a compiled list of words.

; Push value HL to RS

; *** Dictionary ***
; It's important that this part is at the end of the resulting binary.
; A dictionary entry has this structure:
; - Xb name. Arbitrary long number of character (but can't be bigger than
;   input buffer, of course). not null-terminated
; - 2b prev offset
; - 1b size + IMMEDIATE flag
; - 2b code pointer
; - Parameter field (PF)
;
; The prev offset is the number of bytes between the prev field and the
; previous word's code pointer.
;
; The size + flag indicate the size of the name field, with the 7th bit
; being the IMMEDIATE flag.
;
; The code pointer point to "word routines". These routines expect to be called
; with IY pointing to the PF. They themselves are expected to end by jumping
; to the address at (IP). They will usually do so with "jp next".
;
; That's for "regular" words (words that are part of the dict chain). There are
; also "special words", for example NUMBER, LIT, FBR, that have a slightly
; different structure. They're also a pointer to an executable, but as for the
; other fields, the only one they have is the "flags" field.

; This routine is jumped to at the end of every word. In it, we jump to current
; IP, but we also take care of increasing it my 2 before jumping
next:
	; Before we continue: are stacks within bounds?
